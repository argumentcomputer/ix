/-! # The compiler as a pure function

`compile` is the function the certification statements (`Ix.Cert.Statement`)
are about. It is the compile pipeline after canonicalization, as
`Ix.CompileM.compileDecoratedConsts` runs it, with the same stages:

1. the reference graph (`Ix.GraphM`);
2. the ground filter: the immediately ungrounded constants
   (`Ix.groundConstCheck`), spread through the reverse graph
   (`Ix.proliferateUngrounded`), are removed from the graph together with
   every edge into them (`Ix.groundConsts` composes the two);
3. the condensation (`Ix.CondenseM.run`), which `blocksOf` names because the
   Source-mode statements group by it too;
4. the aux-aware driver, `Ix.CompileM.compileEnvAux`.

Its input is `Ix.Environment`, `Ix.CanonM`'s output, which is also Source
mode's input (`Ix.LeanIngress`). Only `env.consts` is read: the streaming
fallback (`Ix.Environment.fallback?`) is dropped.

Every content address it computes (each record, projection and blob) is
`Address.admissionHash`, the hash the authenticated entries check: pure
BLAKE3 (`Address.blake3Pure`) in the logic, executed as the Rust BLAKE3
(`Address.blake3`). The structural hashes of `Ix.Name`, `Ix.Level` and
`Ix.Expr`, which are map keys and never authenticated, stay the Rust
BLAKE3's.

What the IO pipeline does that this function does not:
* it starts from Lean's constants: it resolves source contracts
  (`Ix.Compile.CompileInput.prepare`), refuses unresolved binder contracts,
  inspects semantic contracts and canonicalizes (`Ix.CanonM`) itself;
* it compiles against a hybrid environment, in which theorem and opaque
  bodies are canonicalized again on demand (`fallback?`) instead of
  materialized, and passes the name-hash index (`CompileEnv.nameByHash`)
  that such an environment needs;
* it schedules the driver in parallel waves (`compileEnvParallelAux`) and
  takes the sharing limits from its options (`DriverOptions`);
* it serializes (`Ixon.serEnv`).

**Failures.** The compile records what it leaves out instead of dropping it:
`compileReport` returns, with the environment, every constant the ground
filter removed, with its named refusal (`Ix.GroundError.refusal`, the text
the IO pipeline and the Rust compiler record), and every constant of a block
that failed to compile, with the driver's error (`CompileEnv.ungrounded`: the
block's own failure, a cross-SCC subset's, or a dependent's
`MissingConstant`). `compile` is its first component, so a failure leaves the
result defined; `compileComplete` (the policy `requireComplete`) makes any
failure an error instead.

`Tests.Ix.Cert.Statement` compares the serialized output of the two on the
Source-mode fixtures (`cert-statement`) and on `Init`
(`cert-compile-parity-init`, ignored by default). -/
